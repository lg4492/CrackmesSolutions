# CrackmesSolutions
The solutions I made to various crackmes (reverse engineering challenges) I have done. I created these a while back and figured I would upload them recently.

Crackmes are small programs that are intended to test reverse engineering skills. They usually take the form of a program that generates a key. The goal is to analyze the workings of the program (e.g. with a disassembler) and to create a script (the keygen) that generates a key in the same way as the program.
